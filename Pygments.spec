%description
phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL-server (needs a super-user) but
also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
properly set up MySQL-user which can read/write only the desired
database. It's up to you to look up the appropiate part in the MySQL
manual. Currently phpMyAdmin can:
  - create and drop databases
  - create, copy, drop and alter tables
  - delete, edit and add fields
  - execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
  - manage keys on fields
  - load text files into tables
  - create (*) and read dumps of tables
  - export (*) and import data to CSV values
  - administer multiple servers and single databases
  - check referencial integrity
  - create complex queries automatically connecting required tables
  - create PDF graphics of your database layout
  - communicate in more than 38 different languages
